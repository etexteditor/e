= Git notes =
Windows users in particulary should take note of the Line Endings section.

== Line Endings ==
This is a Linux/Windows cross-platform project. Because of this and git's behavior,
file line-endings are important to get right and keep consistent.

The default for all new files in this repo is to use UNIX-style "LF" endings.
The only time Windows-style line endings "CRLF" should be used is if some 
Windows-specific file requires them to work properly.

=== Git settings ===
For Windows users, edit .git/config and under [core] add the setting:
	autocrlf = false
	
This will preserve line-endings as they exist in the repo.

=== Visual Studio ===

Visual Studio does *not* have a setting for "always use LF"; to save a file 
with different line ends you must use the "File | Advanced Save Options"
dialog and then re-save the file.

Always `git diff` before committing; if every line in a file is marked as
changed then you probably converted CRLF to LF accidentally. Resave the file
and re-diff before committing.


= Header Files =
Compilation on Windows with Visual Studio uses the wxWidgets pre-compiled header.
Including this header will include everything otherwise available through "wx/wx.h"

Linux builds do not have this header available, and must explicitly include "wx/wx.h".

To include files in a cross-platform way, use this pattern:
    #include "wx/wxprec.h"

    #ifndef WX_PRECOMP
    	#include <wx/wx.h>
    #endif
    
    // Other includes not defined in wx/wx.h go here for both platforms.
    // Example:
	#include <wx/arrstr.h>
	
For code that does not require the full wx/wx.h header (usually non-GUI code that
makes use of wx core types), include a smaller set of standard includes within the
WX_PRECOMP block if appropriate.

avenues for bug reports and feature requests, as can be found from the
e homepage.

refactorings may be placed in the GitHub issue tracker:
